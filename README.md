======================

## Description:
----------------------
The digital standards guide is EffectiveUIs most robust delivery mechanism for a project's designs, code snippets, standards, guidelines, etc.  
EffectiveUI recommends that this guide be treated as the source of truth for all of design within a company.

## Quick Setup

The following steps assume you already have node.js and all of the required packages (e.g. grunt, bower, yeoman, etc.) running locally. It's also assumed that you have Sass 3.3+ installed on your machine.

1. `git clone git@git.assembla.com:mwi-digital-standards-guide.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `bower install`
4. you should now be able to run default tasks like `grunt serve` and/ or `grunt build`
