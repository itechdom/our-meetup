	To help with that:
	<ul>
		<li>Start with mobile.</li>
		<li>Write in 4.4 inch width layout.</li>
		<li>Use the <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/" target="_blank">Hemingway editor</a>.</li>
		<li>Instead of “Can we add in....?” or “I see some empty whitespace we can fill” say this “Let’s do a prioritization activity.”</li>
		<li>After that cut it in half. Then cut it in half again.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Think local and action oriented:
	<ul>
		<li>Local: When people are using their mobile devices they are often in need of something nearby. Is there any opportunity to provide local information to CGI's site’s users? Suggest a nearby advisor? Provide rates for their ZIP code?</li>
		<li>Action oriented: Support users’ desire to take immediate action. As much as possible, allow them to complete actions on any device. Instead of “Make an appointment” or “Print and fill out this form” let people complete the action they have become interested in (change investments, apply, etc). Don’t assume “people won’t try to do this on a mobile device.” If you can make it easy enough on a mobile device, they will.</li>
	</ul>

Goodbye PDFs.<br>
PDFs don’t work well in mobile devices. Phones don’t necessarily ship with software that can open PDFs. If they can be opened, your typical 8.5 x11 layout is terrible for viewing on a phone—the user will be forced to do lots of zooming and scrolling around at best.
</p>
<p>For almost all PDFs, the solution is simple (if not easily accomplished). Simply present that content in that digital interface instead.</p>
<p>When the PDF is offered because signatures are needed, consider e-signature or let the user email the PDF to themselves.</p>
